        Our project, Playlister, uses the spotify api to make queries and return songs, 
        and interact with playlists and songs in various ways. Using our CLI app, users 
        are able to:
                
                - Create a profile
                - Log in and Log out
                - Delete profile
                - Create Playlists (public and private)
                - View own playlists and all public playlists
                - Query spotify api about artists, albums, and songs
                - See an artists top songs and albums
                - Save songs to playlists
                - Delete playlists and songs from playlists
                - Get recommended songs based on specific songs from playlist
                - Play full song or sample songs from playlist (playing full song requires user to be logged into spotify on browser)
